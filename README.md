# CyberSecurity Course Repository

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and practical exercises for the Cyber Security course.

I chose to take this introductory course to build a strong foundation in security principles and to better understand how vulnerabilities emerge in real-world systems. As technology becomes increasingly interconnected, I wanted to develop the ability to think critically about system protection, risk assessment, and secure design from the ground up.

Throughout this course, I explored core security concepts such as system architecture, threat modeling, variance analysis, and defensive strategies. Each assignment reflects both the technical understanding developed during the semester and the practical application of security principles.

I found this course particularly engaging because it emphasizes structured thinking — not just solving problems, but identifying risks, evaluating assumptions, and systematically analyzing systems. It helped me better understand how security is not an afterthought, but something that must be designed into systems from the beginning.

This repository is organized by assignment for clarity and easy navigation.
